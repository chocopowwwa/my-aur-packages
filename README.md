# my-aur-packages
My colleciton of AUR packages, feel free to help, copy the code, or take the ownership of the package in AUR.


Help:
- Take the ownership of the package in AUR
- AUR releasing pipeline, I currently manually prepare each repo package for each release, if you have suggestion, feel free to create an issue, thanks :)
